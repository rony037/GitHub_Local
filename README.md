# Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It leverages Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in source code during software development. GitHub provides a user-friendly interface and additional features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

## Key Features
- **Version Control**: Track and manage changes to your codebase.
- **Collaboration**: Work with other developers on the same project.
- **Repositories**: Store and organize your code in repositories.
- **Pull Requests**: Propose changes to the codebase and review them before merging.
- **Issues**: Track bugs and feature requests.
- **Actions**: Automate workflows directly from your repository.

GitHub is widely used by developers and organizations to host open-source projects, contribute to others' projects, and manage private repositories for proprietary software.
